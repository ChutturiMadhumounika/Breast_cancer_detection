# Breast Cancer Classification using ANN

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify breast cancer tumors as **Benign** or **Malignant** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.  
It includes:
- Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding)
- ANN model training with TensorFlow/Keras
- Model saving/loading
- Deployment-ready prediction pipeline
- A Streamlit app for interactive predictions
